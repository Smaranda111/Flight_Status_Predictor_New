# Flight_Status_Predictor_New
The goal of this project is to develop and deploy an ML model in which an end user can specify a set of features describing a commercial flight of interest and receive a categorical (yes or no) output indicating if the arrival time of that flight will be delayed more than fifteen minutes or not.
